# FastAPI
 In here is the result of a collaboration that combines the Machine Learning path and the Cloud Computing path. The Machine Learning path is responsible for developing prediction functionality, while the Cloud Computing path is Cloud Computing creates functions to get information data from the Firestore database and deploy it to GCP using the Cloud Run service.

Collaboration between these two pathways has significant benefits. By utilizing artificial intelligence through Machine Learning, we can develop predictive models that are capable of processing and analyzing data with high accuracy. Then, using Cloud Computing, we can efficiently access and manage the required data from the Firestore database. The Cloud Run service on GCP also enables scalable and accessible implementation of these functions.
